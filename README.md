# Pipelined RISC-V Processor
This repository consists all the code for our Computer Architecture & Organizations's final project. All the code is written in Verilog HDL.
The processor sorts the following array of numbers in the descending order: {1, 5, 3, 4, 10, 22, 2, 3, 44} using the selection sort algorithm.
